Johannesburg &#8211; The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria ordered the government to increase the tariff on wheat imports by 30%, the country&#8217;s largest grain producer body said on Thursday, a measure that should have been implemented weeks ago.South Africa changes the tariff on a regular basis using a variable formula based on world price movements. Industry group Grain SA says the tariff should have been adjusted in late May to R1 591 a tonne, from R1 224, a 30% hike.READ ALSO :ANCYL want the ANC top six leaders overhaulWhen the adjustment is calculated, it typically also takes a few weeks for it to be signed off and implemented, but Grain SA said the government was taking too long and took the case to court.&#8220;The Court instructed Sars (South African Revenue Service) to publish the new tariff in the Government Gazette no later than Wednesday 24 August 2016,&#8221; Grain SA said in a statement. Publishing the tariff in this manner brings it into effect.READ ALSO : Malema played us - Gwede Mantashe&#8220;Trading in the South African wheat market almost came to a halt given all the uncertainties and delays.
