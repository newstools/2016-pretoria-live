Julius Malema is used to making headlines but rarely opens up about his personal life. He was on Real Talk with Anele Mdoda where he couldn&#8217;t escape questions about his private life and his relationship with his wife.Speaking his wife, Mantwa, Julius said that his life has changed a lot.&#8220;I used to drink and go to clubs. I started going to movies now because my wife forced me.&#8221;He explained that at first he resisted the suggestions, saying that there will be a lot of people and &#8220;what if I pass out. I&#8217;m going to be a joke&#8221;.But Mantwa persisted and Julius said he is grateful.&#8220;My wife came into my life full time like that when my boy was almost 8. My boy has been trying to get me to the movies and he didn&#8217;t succeed because I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m busy. Now I&#8217;m dragged into movies.&#8221;But Julius still battles to attend movies because he doesn&#8217;t understand &#8220;white people when they speak&#8221;.&#8220;I can&#8217;t hear the white people when they speak. Then I keep on saying &#8216;what are they saying?&#8217; Then when I ask, someone is trying to call me to order and &#8216;sssh.'&#8221;His wife called him to order and told him to &#8220;behave&#8221; when they arrived.Anele asked him whose call he will always take, no matter what.&#8220;My wife&#8217;s number. Even if I put &#8216;do not disturb&#8217; on the phone. I put her on favourites so she can come through. There will be trouble at home. At home it must be peaceful. I can&#8217;t be fighting with Zuma and there&#8217;s another Zuma in the house.&#8221;Julius explained that his wife isn&#8217;t afraid to call him out when he does things wrong.&#8220;Then I go home and I&#8217;m woken up at two in the morning. &#8216;Hey, just tell me why you are not answering my phone.&#8221;Speaking about his marriage, Julius explained that his wife has opened him up to new things.&#8220;She completes me. She&#8217;s able to speak a lot of sense and persuade me to see certain things different and get me to do things I haven&#8217;t done. And watching Perfect Wedding (Our Perfect Wedding). Things I used to think were girly things&#8230; I enjoy them.&#8221;
