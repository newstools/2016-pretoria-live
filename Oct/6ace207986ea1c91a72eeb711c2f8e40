AKA wants his expensive Versace chain back and is willing to fork out some extra cash to reward the person who brings it back to him.During his headline set at Spring Fiesta, AKA got a tad bit too excited and threw his gold Versace pendant into the crowd. He followed that up with his sunglasses, which he famously wears at night events too.Minutes after realising what he had done, AKA asked the crowd which individual had caught the chain. Even though no one came forward, he told them that they should take that s**t to the bank .A day later, AKA expressed some serious regret over his typical hip hop move. He tweeted that the chain was actually a gift from a friend and had sentimental value.RELATED&gt;&gt;&gt;Please guys! I love that pendant! ???? I&#39;ll buy it back. I was overcome with the vibes and the energy. I also threw my shades into the crowd. pic.twitter.com/fz8lqOE96r&mdash; AKA (@akaworldwide) October 2, 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank You Spring Fiesta &#8230; The energy was insane.
