&#8220;I killed Dineo,&#8221; these chilling words were allegedly uttered by a voice on the other end of the line when Thomas Chabalala answered his phone. Yesterday Chabalala, 37, recalled the phone call, allegedly from the man now being hunted by Limpopo police in connection with the murder of his sister-in-law, Refilwe Masinamela, 23, popularly known as Dineo.Masinamela, a University of Venda student and mother of two from Maapane village in Modjadjiskloof, was found dead inside her boyfriend&#8217;s residence on Thursday.Police reported at the weekend that they were looking for the 25-old suspect after they found the stabbed body of Masinamela &#8211; believed to be his lover &#8211; at the Tshilidzini Hospital near Thohoyandou.Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the suspect was on the run while police investigations continued. Ngoepe said they would only be able to establish the amount of times Masinamela had been stabbed once the postmortem report was completed.Speaking to Sowetan, Chabalala related how he received a disturbing phone call &#8211; apparently from the suspect &#8211; on Thursday around 5.38pm claiming that he had killed Masinamela and that her body would be found in his room at the hospital.&#8220;The caller introduced himself &#8230; He kept on saying I killed Dineo. You must go to Tshilidzini to fetch her body so that you can bury her,&#8221; he said.Chabalala said he called police in Thohoyandou a few minutes after the phone call and requested them to check out the suspect&#8217;s room. He said police later called to inform him that the suspect&#8217;s room was locked.&#8220;The police then broke the door and found the deceased&#8217;s body in a pool of blood,&#8221; Chabalala said.He said he had only spoken to the suspect on the phone on a few occasions before the incident. This was when the suspect wanted help with finding a driving instructor.Chabalala said the suspect seemed to be a jealous and possessive boyfriend as he would sometimes require Masinamela to make video calls as a way of ascertaining her location. The couple had been dating for about eight months. However, Chabalala said the family never suspected that their relationship was experiencing problems.Chabalala described how Masinamela&#8217;s body had stab wounds on the neck and back. Only the muffled sobs of Masinamela&#8217;s aunt, Lucy Masinamela, 51, could be heard as she covered her face with a blanket. Lucy raised Masinamela and her younger sister after their parents died some years back.READ ALSO&gt;&gt;&gt;Shivambu and Malema fighting over ANC merger talk The aunt said she was looking forward to seeing Masinamela graduate next year. &#8220;She was a loving child.
