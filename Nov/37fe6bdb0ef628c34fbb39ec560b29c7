ANC Secretary General has submitted his resignation to party president Jacob Zuma, close sources have revealed. The letter has been tabled to Zuma for his consideration.Mantashe who has been leading the call for party leaders to step down, has demonstrated by doing it himself. It feels like the job of administering a fragmented party has become too much for him. Last month he openly said, &#8220;this job will kill me,&#8221; and suggested that leaving the party would be better than staying in it.Whats remains to be seen is whether President Zuma will accept the resignation.&nbsp;
