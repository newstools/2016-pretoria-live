Our key objective tonight really is to talk about two things. How can a billion rand worth of public property be destroyed and there seems to be no criminal outcome behind that or no policing that takes place? We must talk about security on campus but we must also talk about the fact that the funding crisis cannot continue without political leadership given to it.
