The criminal case the EFF will open relates to the prima facie evidence contained in the affidavit of Pravin Gordhan s application.The EFF has laid criminal charges against the Gupta family, specifically Atul, Ajay, and Rajesh Gupta; and all directors of their companies, including Predident Jacob Zuma s son Duduzane Zuma, who is Jacob Zuma s proxy in Gupta businesses , the EFF said on Sunday. The criminal case the EFF will open relates to the prima facie evidence contained in the affidavit of Minister of Finance s [Pravin Gordhan] application to the High Court filed on the 14th of October 2016, EFF acting spokesman Fana Mokoena said in a statement. The minister s application reveals the information already hinted [at] by the banks that the Gupta family and their businesses are involved in money laundering, racketeering, and gross corruption that is robbing South Africa of billions of rands. The immediate amount that has been confirmed to have been suspiciously transferred is R6.8 billion and it is clear that this amount is just the tip of an iceberg, he said.The EFF leadership believed that a thorough criminal investigation which should be defined by the co-operation of the banks, the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), the National Treasury, Lanseria Airport staff members, and many others would reveal the extent and depth of the Gupta criminal syndicate, which is in the process of drying out South Africa s resources , Mokoena said.The charges were laid at the Rosebank police station in Johannesburg on Sunday afternoon.
