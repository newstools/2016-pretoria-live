JOHANNESBURG: The South African government is to pay damages to victims of a 2012 police shooting that left 34 mineworkers dead and dozens hurt, the presidency said Thursday. In a victory for the victims and their families, the government said it was ready to make an offer to settle these claims in the next few months.

It was the worst police violence in South Africa since the end of apartheid 21 years ago.Presidential spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga told reporters that there were 34 claims for loss of support, 81 for injuries suffered during the shooting, and 275 for unlawful arrest. Some of the claims overlap, he added. Last year families of the victims lodged compensation claims against the government, listing a total of 326 dependents as having been affected by the violence.READ ALSO :ANCYL want the ANC top six leaders overhaul An official inquiry established by President Jacob Zuma put much of the blame for the massacre on police tactics used to disperse the strikers, but it did not go as far as recommending compensation. George Bizos, one of the lawyers that represented the affected families during the Marikana inquiry would have preferred for the families to receive temporary relief while the compensation amounts were being finalized. We welcome the statement, but I am concerned that it s going to take another few months for the widows that have had nothing for the past over years, Bizos said.SOURCE :READ ALSO:DA councillor Hannes Beitjies shot dead
