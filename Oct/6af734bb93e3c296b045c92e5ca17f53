Together with Mandoza s manager, the people s poet is said to have created a letter requesting funds on behalf of the late Kwaito star.Mpho Tshabalala, the wife of Mandoza, was shocked to discover a letter written to the Music Association of South Africa (MASA), requesting cash to fund Nkalakhatha Records.According to Sunday World, Mbuli and Kevin Ntaopane are behind the letter. The two created it without consulting Mpho and proceeded to submit it to MASA with the aim of getting an undisclosed amount of money in Mandoza s name.Mpho said she was awaiting evidence from the music association before pressing fraud charges against Mbuli and Ntaopane. I was at Samro offices after the death of my husband to enquire about his royalties when I bumped into Tebogo [Sithathu], who told me he received my letter and was processing it. I then asked him what letter? He said the letter that was sent to him by Mzwakhe and Kelvin asking for funds for Nkalakatha. I was shell shocked and told him I didn t know what he was talking about. I felt like crying; how can people do these things to us? Sithathu confirmed the existence of the letter, while Ntaopane denied knowing anything about the letter. That s fraud. I will talk to Mzwakhe about this. I think whoever is responsible must be charged with fraud because the letter is fake, said Sithathu.Mbuli did not respond to requests for comment.
