EFF leader Julius Malema had plans to meet Fezeka Kuzwayo and apologise to her personally. &#8220;I&#8217;ve apologised to Kuzwayo and she passes on at a time when we were actually preparing to go and see [her] in person to apologise to her,&#8221; Malema said yesterday.He said he now planned to extend the apology to Kuzwayo&#8217;s mother.&#8220;I will never have a problem apologising to her mother.&#8220;That&#8217;s how far I&#8217;m prepared to go and send condolences to the family and to repeat my public apology.&#8220;I wanted to apologise to her. We were working towards visiting her,&#8221; Malema added.When he was president of the ANC Youth League in 2009, Malema had controversially said Kuzwayo had had a &#8220;nice&#8221; time with Zuma.&#8220;When a woman didn&#8217;t enjoy it, she leaves early in the morning. Those who had a nice time will wait until the sun comes out, request breakfast and ask for taxi money,&#8221; Malema told students at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology at the time.READ ALSO>>>Open Letter and Warning To ANCYL from a Concerned citizen&#8220;In the morning, that lady requested breakfast and taxi money.&#8221;Malema publicly apologised to Kuzwayo in 2009 following a ruling against him by the Equality Court.
