#Feesmustfall had harsh words for Skhumba who said Please don t show your boobs. When a boob shows, it should be like a tennis (ball), he said in a short clip in Zulu.&#8220;These females are showing hanging boobs that look like wet all-stars without shoe laces. Others have big tummies with silver stripes,&#8221; he went on to say.He went on to question what type of people go to Wits, before likening the institution to the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), suggesting that the topless students look like &#8220;grannies&#8221;.&#8220;A student with a silver stripe?&#8221; he asked.&#8220;With boobs hanging all the way to the belly. Please put your clothes on,&#8221; he added.However students lashed at Skhumba saying he does not have a sense of hygiene. &#8220;We will not allow under any circumstances any commedian or radio host to ridicule black female bodies we are very clear this man called Skhumba or whoever he call himself must first fix himself.&#8221;&#8216;He must fix himself first, hands off our bodies, if we decide to protest naked that will be that.&#8221; Students pledged for ears only not that they pick rocks for fun. &#8220;All we want is to be listened to because if leaders do not listen to us then the future is doomed.&#8221;READ ALSO>>>We know they are killers but they won t kill us all Malema urges #FeesMustFall protestersAlso Hlengiwe Ndlovu, who was part of the three students who went topless is currently working on a thesis towards her PHD at the University of the Witwatersrand. She is also one of three women who took off their bras during a #FeesMustFall protest on Tuesday October 4 saying they were tired of being brutalised.In an interview with the Northcliff Melville Times she explained their reasoning.Their main objective she said was to stop police discharging stun grenades to disperse students. The narrative that appeared on TV changed that particular moment. If you see a woman stripping it means that it is a broader societal problem in terms of violence she said. The moment that we stepped into the protest because as much we were displaying the intolerance of violence at the same time it was a form of resistance to say the very same woman s body is capable of ceasing fire and no one from national or local government could stop it she told the newspaper. It s for free education. Stop shooting us comrades. Cease fire comrades. It s for free education they were heard chanting in a video posted on Twitter by @LirandzuThemba.
