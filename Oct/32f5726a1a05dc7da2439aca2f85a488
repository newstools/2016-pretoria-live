Your parents have entrusted you to him he is now the parent &#8221; said Mpofu.The EFF leader said he&#8217;d be engaging with Habib on the 11th floor of Solomon Mahlangu House along with former Black Student Societies (BSS) presidents including professor Firoz Chachalia who was the first president of the BSS in 1980.The BSS were elected bodies aimed at representing the specific interests of black students who at the time due to apartheid policies constituted an artificial minority on campuses.Mpofu said they would put two demands on the table: to personally address the students as well as shut the university.&#8220;In the meantime it cannot be business as usual and I don&#8217;t want to get into details as to what must happen because we emphasize that this is not our struggle it is your struggle &#8221; added Mpofu.He said he would inform student leaders about the outcome of the meeting with Habib.Mpofu spent most of Tuesday on campus as a large group of students engaged in running battles with police leaving several people injured including students a lecturer journalists and police.The EFF national chairman said he had intervened in the chaos not in his official capacity but as a concerned parent.READ ALSO&gt;&gt;&gt;Students go topless to keep police away&#8220;The key issue is that we must all try and save the academic year and on that we are all 100% agreed &#8221; he told radio 702 (www.702.co.za) in an interview on Tuesday afternoon adding that he was on his way to meet vice-chancellor Professor Adam Habib with several proposals made by student leaders.&#8220;If we can get consensus before the end of today on what should happen tomorrow and the next day and so on then we will be able to announce together with the university what should happen in the next 24-48 hours &#8221; he said.Sounding confident that parties would find each other he said: &#8220;After our meeting with Prof Habib and others we will speak to the students and I think later tonight or in the morning there will be some broad consensus of what should happen in the next 48 hours&#8221;.This he said would lead to a situation where &#8220;hopefully there will be compromises that we will be asking for on both sides which can lead up to arresting the situation and ensuring that there is a moratorium on violence on both sides of the divide&#8221;.Habib reacted on air by saying that he welcomed the window of opportunity to reach some form of negotiated settlement adding that his main concern was seeing 37 000 students pass and graduate.READ ALSO&gt;&gt;&gt; We have to do something about free education Mbeki on #FeesMustFall
