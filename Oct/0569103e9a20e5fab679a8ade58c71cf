All these people who are sitting here most of them have qualifications but if you can take me head on they know I mesmerise them. When people make noise even people you admire run away and they won t transform this country. I m not a coward said Motsoeneng.I m employed here at the SABC I have never employed myself. I have never said to the SABC that I wanted to be the COO (chief operating officer).

Earlier this week, Parliament expressed its lack of faith in the broadcaster s board for re-appointing Motsoeneng to a senior position. The Broadcasting, Electronic, Media &#038; Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) s Hannes du Buisson says this latest move requires urgent intervention. It cannot continue like that. The entire country; the courts, Parliaments and everyone is against the appointment of Mr Motsoeneng. The board is allowing him to continue and the minister is allowing to continue in that way.
