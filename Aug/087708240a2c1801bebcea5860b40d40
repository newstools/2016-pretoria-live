The woman was surprised and with a lot of hope she said, Yes! Yes! It does it every day and it makes me so sad because I see something asking of me, and I cannot help it feel better. Then, the vet said something shocking and most unexpected. Madam, your pet is not sick; it is just preparing to eat you. Yes, the python wasn t sick but it has been preparing to eat her instead! Every time, it is creeping and hugging you, wrapping around your body, it is checking size to weigh how a great meal you are and how it must be prepared before the attack. And yes, it does not eat, in order to have enough space to digest you more easily, the vet said.This story comes with a moral Even people close to you, whom you are very affectionate with, can, have mean intentions. You need to identify the snake around you and their true intent. Hugs and kisses are not always honest.Don t fear the enemy that attacks you, but the fake friend that hugs you.RELATED: Second Jesus to be delivered by Mary Bushiri
