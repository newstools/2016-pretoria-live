When the President and Finance minister flew in different planes the presidency criticised a report for distorting facts over a report about Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan s travel itinerary to the G20 Summit with President Zuma.In the piece, the reporter, who the presidency claimed normally reports on rumours and gossip , also laments that the president flew on a chartered aircraft while Gordhan travelled on a commercial flight.Speculation that tension is high between President Jacob Zuma and finance minister makes people to think that the two can see each other eye to eye. However they are together attending G20. China President had this to say with the aid of an interpreter of course.&#8220;We resolved to revitalise international trade and investment as key engines of growth. We agreed to improve the G20 trade and investment mechanism and endorse the G20 strategy for global trade growth and move towards inclusive and coordinated global value chains. We support the multi-lateral regime and oppose protectionism so as to release the potential of global business cooperation and reverse the decline of global growth.&#8221;One of the resolutions by the leaders is to placed Africa at the centre of the G20 developmental agenda. The leaders have also agreed to look at long term policy formulation to enable positive economic growth.The two-day meeting, attended by President Jacob Zuma, focussed on new strategies and innovations to boost the global economy.The meeting has been described as a big talk shop. Developing countries, particularly Africa, feeling left out.But the sole continent&#8217;s voice, South Africa, has been relentless in raising Africa&#8217;s issues and it seems the world has listened. This is one of many decisions taken here to revive the global economic growth.From undertaking financial reforms, to embracing innovations and deepening tax cooperation as well as lending support to developing countries.The body has also undertaken to engage in many reforms. It says it can no longer allow the status quo as the world has moved with new technologies.While the G20 leaders seem to be hitting all the right notes, it&#8217;s the implementation of their plans which will determine whether the actions they&#8217;ve taken do indeed re-ignite the much needed economic growth which will help reduce poverty and create jobs for millions of people.Leaders who attended the just-ended G2 summit in Hangzhou, China, have demanded the reform of the world&#8217;s lending institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.They&#8217;ve urged the IMF to reassign its quota and voting rights to ensure that that it fairly reflects the status of emerging markets and developing countries.
