We remind South Africans as well that we warned them that the Guptas and their puppets are illegally smuggling large amounts of money out of the country.

However they must be warned that we will do everything in our power to expose and block all their attempts to continue running this country into the quagmire of corruption and daylight kleptocracy the EFF asserted.READ ALSO : Don t be clever Guptas, anyone who want to act as front be warned Malema
