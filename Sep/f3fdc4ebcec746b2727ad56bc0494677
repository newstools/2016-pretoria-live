While the ANC cried foul over a decision by money managers to suspend loans to state-owned entities because President Jacob Zuma took control over them, economists warned more investors could follow suit. Senior economist Azar Jammine said the ANC had to remove Zuma to deal with the crisis engulfing SOEs.Yesterday, Denmark&#8217;s Jyske Bank became the latest to suspend loans to Eskom.On Wednesday, Futuregrowth, one of the country&#8217;s largest asset managers, suspended loans to Eskom, Transnet, Sanral, Landbank, the IDC and DBSA.This means they will not be able to borrow money from local investors, who are cheaper than international lenders.Asset managers control and invest billions in workers&#8217; pensions, among others.Mngxitama a messenger of the Guptas -DA members shouted throwing him outFights in branches of government over control of the multibillion-rand SOEs, the threat over the independence of Treasury and &#8220;the recent and sudden announcement that the Presidency would chair a council&#8221; to directly oversee the SOEs informed the decision.Futuregrowth warned it might suspend loans to more SOEs.The ANC said Futuregrowth&#8217;s &#8220;generalisation&#8221; that there were problems of corporate governance at SOEs was &#8220;erroneous&#8221; and &#8220;unfortunate&#8221;.ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said the establishment of an inter-ministerial committee chaired by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was one of the initiatives taken to fix SOEs.Jammine said Futuregrowth&#8217;s move meant there was suspicion that Zuma&#8217;s takeover of parastatals came because he could not fire Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and was acting to benefit himself and friends.&#8220;There is a big risk that other fund managers might follow in Futuregrowth&#8217;s footsteps and the only way to fix the situation would be for the ANC to get rid of the president,&#8221; said Jammine.Economist Dawie Roodt said this was the first time an asset manager had boycotted SOEs.Economist Duma Gqubule said it was clear fund managers do not trust Zuma.&#8220;When Cyril was chairing a similar council, the same fund managers did not have a problem with him,&#8221; he said.He said if more fund managers boycotted SOEs, this would be worse than a downgrade because the entities would be required to obtain capital from international bondholders who are more expensive than local funders.READ ALSO : ANC concerned with increased murder rate -Jackson Mthembu
